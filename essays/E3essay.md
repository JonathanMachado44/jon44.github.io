<p2>Summary </p2> <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-preparing-for-WOD.html">link to assignment page</a>

<p>The WODs for the E3 essay are Browser history 6, where we needed to create separate webpages for the different browsers that we talked about, Invoice1, where we needed to create a dynamic sales receipt that contained at least 5 different products, and Smartphone Products 2, which aimed to eliminate hard coding we did for our spartphone products page.</p>

<p>Browser History 6</p>

<p>The Browser History 6 WOD took me 3 tries to get the standard time. One thing that went well in this WoD was creating the different web pages, tht was not a problem for me. One of the things I had trouble with was configuring the buttons, that took a decent chunk of my time to figure out. I prepared for the WOD by reading the instructions and practicing until I got the standard time. I could have done better by doing more practice runs and reading the instructions more carefully. </p>
