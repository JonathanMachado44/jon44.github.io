<p2>Summary </p2> <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-preparing-for-WOD.html">link to assignment page</a>

<p>The WODs for the E3 essay are Browser history 6, where we needed to create separate webpages for the different browsers that we talked about, Invoice1, where we needed to create a dynamic sales receipt that contained at least 5 different products, and Smartphone Products 2, which aimed to eliminate hard coding we did for our spartphone products page.</p>

<p>Browser History 6</p>

<p>The Browser History 6 WOD took me 2 tries to get the standard time. One thing that went well in this WoD was creating the different web pages, tht was not a problem for me. One of the things I had trouble with was configuring the buttons, that took a decent chunk of my time to figure out. I prepared for the WOD by reading the instructions and practicing until I got the standard time. I could have done better by doing more practice runs and reading the instructions more carefully. </p>

<p>Invoice 1</p>

<p> For this WOD I was able to finish within the standard time. One thing that that went well for me in this WOD was adding in comments so that I knwe what my code was doing, this really helped me keep organized while I was doing my WOD. One thing I had a hard time with was trying to not hard code data into the table. Like pervious WODS, I prepared for the WOD by reading the instructions and practicing until I got the standard time. I could have done better by doing more practice runs and reading the instructions more carefully.</p>

<p>Smartphone Products 1 with variables</p>

<p> For this WOD, I was able to finish within the RX time in 1 attempts. One thing that went well in this WOD was not hard coding anything, I was able to follow the instructions with little to no hiccups. One thing I struggled with was the last part of the WOD where you needed to get the console to output that the products had loaded, for some reason it was not showing up in my console. Again like pervious WODS, I prepared for the WOD by reading the instructions and practicing until I got the standard time. I could have done better by doing more practice runs and reading the instructions more carefully.</p>

<p>Improvements for future WODS</p>

<p>I think some of the thinks I can do to be better prepared for future WODS is to do more practice runs for the excercises along with reading the readings more intently so I am not as confused when it is time to do the WOD. I believe this will help me do the WODS faster.</p>
