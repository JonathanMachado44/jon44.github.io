  <p>1) Briefly describe your system:</p>

<p>My website sells cat care products, it has three product pages with six items on each page for the categories of food, toys, and misc items. The users are able to add items to their cart without logging in, however, they are unable to check out without logging in or creating an account. The user then is able to check out and their invoice will be emailed to them.</p>

<p>2) Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?</p>

<p>There were two notable shortcomings in my website. I could not figure out how to implement my IR which required me to think of another method of changing the price aside from the quantity of a product. The second one was that for some reason when I try to register a new account on my website I get an error message, however, the rest of my website seems to work fine.</p>

<p>3) Describe what you are most proud of about your system:</p>

<p>I am honestly just proud that I was able to produce a mostly functioning website, during finals week I ran into a lot of problems both in and outside of school that took my attention away from Assignment 3, so the fact that I was able to finish the project on time is something I’m really proud of.</p>

<p>4) Describe what you are least happy with your system:</p>

<p>I think I’m the least happy with my UI for the website. I would say that the design of my website is kind of basic, I think what happened was that I wanted to focus on the functionality of my website the most rather than the aesthetics of it, and thus that aspect of my website suffered.</p>

<p>5) How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?</p>

<p>Assignment 2 was different because in Assignment 3 we had to implement features such as sessions and cookies that allow the website to store data for a specific user and pass it through multiple pages. In addition to implementing sessions and cookies, we also had to send a confirmation email to the user after completing their purchase.</p>

<p>6) When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?</p>

<p>Just like assignment 2, my go-to resource was the internet. The main websites that I would go to for help were w3 and Stackoverflow. Additionally, I would also look up examples that were similar to the task or objective I was trying to achieve.</p>

<p>7) Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?</p>

<p>I think the most notable aspect of my assignment that worked well was the shopping cart, it had all of the features that it needed such as being able to update item quantities and being able to save previous items when the user goes back to the product pages to add more.</p>

<p>8) Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?</p>

<p>As I said previously, some aspects such as my registration page were not working on the class web server but runs fine when it is on my local server. If I had more time, I would try to solve that problem.</p>

<p>9) What did you learn from doing this assignment?</p>

<p>I learned that it may be beneficial to anticipate future assignments, particularly if they are connected to previous ones. I think that considering upcoming requirements for assignments would help to save time. I had to spend a significant portion of my time reworking Assignment 2 to meet the updated requirements of Assignment 3.</p>

<p>10) If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?</p>

<p>I think that I would have started the assignment even earlier. I started around when E5 was due but I still don’t think that was enough time. As I said before, I spent a significant portion of my time reworking Assignment 2 to meet the updated requirements of Assignment 3.</p>

<p>11) Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</p>

<p>For assignment 3 I think I spent around 15% of the time thinking about how to do something, 50% writing code, and about 35% debugging my code.</p>

<p>12) Assign an estimated percentage of the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)</p>

<p>I worked alone on this assignment</p>
