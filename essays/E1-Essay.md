<h2>WOD 1 <h2/>

For the first WOD the main focus was greating a basic functioning web page that talked about the history of web browsers. We used HTML tags to organize paragraphs and headers, linking to other websites, along with formatting images. I was able to finish this WOD on the second time for the standard time.

WOD 2

The second WoD utilized a styles.css page which was used to change the overall look of the webpage. Overall, thought this WOD was pretty straightforward. I was able to finish this Wod with in the RX time on my second try. 

WOD 3

This WOD focused on using div tags in the index.html page to change the alignment of the paragraphs. Along with using .right, .left, .center in the .css page to define the newly created classes. I did have some trouble with making the columns for the browser information, but I figured out that it was because I did not close the div tags. I did 3 tries and made the standard time

What I found the most helpful was the screencasts, I was able to figure out for the most part what was wrong with my code and able to fix the problems accordingly.
