WOD 1

For the first WOD the main focus was greating a basic functioning web page that talked about the history of web browsers. We used HTML tags to organize paragraphs and headers, linking to other websites, along with formatting images. I was able to finish this WOD on the first try for the standard time 

WOD 2

The second WoD utilized a styles.css page which was used to change the overall look of the webpage. I was able to finish this Wod with in the RX time on my second try. I was having trouble starting my server the first time which made my time a lot longer. Other than that hickup i think I did okay on it.

WOD 3

This WOD focused on using div tags in the index.html page to change the alignment of the paragraphs. Along with using .right, .left, .center in the .css page to define the newly created classes. For the last Wod I was not able to figure out how to get the chrome section in the middle. I was able to get FireFox and IE on the lect and right and make the nav bar at the top of the page. I did 3 tries and was only able to make the DNF time. 

What I found the most helpful was the screencasts, I was able to figure out for the most part what was wrong with my code and able to fix the problems accordingly.
